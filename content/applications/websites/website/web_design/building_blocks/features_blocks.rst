Features blocks
===============

Use the :guilabel:`Features` blocks to enhance your website with advanced functionalities, such as
product or service attributes. The blocks from this category, such as the
:ref:`Table of content <features_blocks/table_of_content>`, allow you to present the content of your
website in an illustrative method rather than sticking to the textual content.

================

You can add a :guilabel:`Table of content` building block to your website by dragging and dropping
it from the :guilabel:`Features` blocks section in the website configurator.

Once added, you can customize the appearance and functionality of the table of contents.

Header 2 titles automatically appear on the left of your page, helping users navigate your content
more efficiently.
