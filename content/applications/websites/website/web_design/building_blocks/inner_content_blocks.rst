Inner content building blocks
=============================

The inner content building blocks allow you to add elements such as videos, images, and
:ref:`Social Media <inner_content_blocks/social_media>` redirection buttons, into pre-existing
:doc:`building blocks <../building_blocks>`.

To do so, access a website page and open the website builder by clicking :guilabel:`Edit`. Then,
drag and drop a block from the :guilabel:`Inner content` section of the :guilabel:`Blocks` tab onto
your web page.
