Digest emails
=============

*Digest Emails* are periodic snapshots sent via email to users in an organization that include
high-level information about how the business is performing.

Navigate to Digest Emails by going to :menuselection:`Settings app --> General Settings -->
Statistics`, then activate the :guilabel:`Digest Emails` feature and click on :guilabel:`Save`.

A variety of settings can be configured for Digest Emails, such as:

- Which :abbr:`KPIs (key performance indicators)` are shared in the digest emails
- How often digest emails are sent
- Who in the organization receives digest emails
- Creating custom digest email templates
- Adding additional :abbr:`KPIs (key performance indicators)` (*Studio* app required)

.. note::
   By default, Digest Email is *enabled*, and *Your Odoo Periodic Digest* serves as the primary
   template, which includes all :abbr:`KPI (key performance indicator)` measurements across the Odoo
   database and is sent daily to administrators.

.. warning::
   When creating duplicates of databases that have sending capabilities (not testing-mode) the
   digest emails will continue to send from the duplicate database unless deactivated. To deactivate
   the duplicate database, navigate to :menuselection:`Settings --> General Settings -->
   Statistics`. Then deactivate the :guilabel:`Digest Emails` feature by un-ticking the checkbox and
   click on :guilabel:`Save`.

After clicking :guilabel:`Save`, the new custom digest email is available as a selection in the

.. _digest-emails/custom-kpi:

Custom KPIs with Studio
=======================

The :abbr:`KPIs (key performance indicators)` can be customized using Odoo *Studio*.

.. warning::
   Additional costs to the database subscription will be incurred should *Studio* need to be
   installed.

For either *Your Odoo Periodic Digest* or a custom digest email, :abbr:`KPIs (key performance
indicators)` can be added by using Odoo *Studio*.

To begin, click the :guilabel:`üõ†Ô∏è (tools)` icon in the top right of the screen. This is the link to
the *Studio* application.

In order to create additional fields, create two fields on the digest object:

#. Create a boolean field called `kpi_myfield` and display it in the :guilabel:`KPIs` tab.
#. Create a computed field called `kpi_myfield_value` that computes the customized :abbr:`KPI (key
   performance indicator)`.
#. Select the :abbr:`KPIs (key performance indicators)` in the :guilabel:`KPIs` tab.

.. tip::
   Here is the `source code
   <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/aa09df25845f5497124185013bdb5706fcb2b082/addons/digest/models/digest.py>`_
   for the digest.py file, which will guide the programmer in the coding of the computed field.

.. seealso::
   An alternative is to click the :guilabel:`Recipients` tab and then the :guilabel:`...` (ellipses)
   to edit this view. Either click :guilabel:`EDIT LIST VIEW` or :guilabel:`EDIT FORM VIEW` to
   modify this tab.
